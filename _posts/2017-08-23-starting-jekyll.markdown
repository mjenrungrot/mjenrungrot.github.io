I have been looking for a good template where I can write my personal technical blog and then save it on GitHub.
What I found is pretty interesting: [Jekyll][jekyll-main]. Jekyll is a simple site generator that can converts files like Markdown to decent HTML pages. It's also very easy to install on Linux or macOS. If anyone works with Django before, Jekyll will be very easy to use.

Here is the basic usage script:
{% highlight bash %}
# Installation
gem install jekyll

# Generate site at ./_site
jekyll build

# Locally run the server at http://localhost:4000
jekyll serve
{% endhighlight %}

For more details, you can just look at [Jekyll Documentation][jekyll-doc].
