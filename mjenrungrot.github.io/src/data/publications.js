      In this paper, we investigates a cross-modal retrieval problem
      in which a user would like to retrieve a passage of music from 
      a MIDI file by taking a cell phone picture of a physical page
      of sheet music. We used a novel mid-level feature representation
      called a bootleg score that explicitly encodes the rules of
      Western musical notation.`,
